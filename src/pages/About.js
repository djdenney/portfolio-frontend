                        ok, so somehow i've gotta explain who i am as a person
                        but my explanation needs to be different than my
                        linkedin profile's 'about' section and the professional
                        summary on my resum√©. i can't exactly talk about how
                        good i am at coding, because i have 0 years of
                        experience and my portfolio is basically just a bunch of
                        school projects, so when i say i know what i'm doing it
                        probably doesn't mean much to you. i can confidently say
                        that i know javascript, react, express, postgresql, and
                        node. i can also confidently say that if you asked me to
                        write a quicksort algorithm i would probably end up with
                        some needlessly recursive stackoverflow frankenstein
                        solution and hope prettierjs could make it look
                        passable.
